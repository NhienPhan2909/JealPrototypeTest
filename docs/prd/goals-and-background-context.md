# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Complete functional 2-dealership prototype with public site + admin CMS deployed to live URL within 2 days (48 hours)
- Demonstrate multi-tenant architecture works seamlessly for 2+ dealerships from single codebase/database instance
- Validate that entire platform can run on free tiers (Cloudinary, PostgreSQL, hosting) without functional limitations for small dealership use case
- Provide affordable, scalable dealership web platform that can be deployed rapidly for real-world dealership customers
- Enable dealership staff to manage vehicle inventory and view customer leads efficiently from integrated admin CMS
- Capture qualified leads from website visitors browsing dealership inventory
- Establish foundation for long-term SaaS platform supporting multiple independent dealerships

## Background Context

Car dealerships of all sizes face significant barriers to establishing effective online presence. Commercial dealership website platforms charge $200-$1000+/month with rigid templates and vendor lock-in, making them prohibitive for small independent lots. Website builders lack inventory management capabilities, and custom development is expensive with long timelines. This creates a competitive disadvantage for smaller dealerships in an increasingly digital automotive retail market.

This PRD addresses the problem by defining a unified, multi-tenant platform combining public-facing dealership websites (vehicle browsing, search, detail pages, lead capture) with an integrated CMS for inventory and dealership management. Built entirely on free, open-source technologies (Node.js/Express, React, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary), the solution targets car dealerships from small independent lots to large multi-site franchises. The 2-day prototype timeline validates rapid deployment feasibility while establishing architecture that scales from single dealership to multi-tenant SaaS platform.
