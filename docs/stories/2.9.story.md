## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Changes

**New Fields Added to Dealership Table:**
- `finance_policy` (TEXT, nullable) - stores financing policy content
- `warranty_policy` (TEXT, nullable) - stores warranty policy content

**Migration Script:** `backend/db/migrations/add_finance_warranty_fields.sql`

**API Changes:**
- `GET /api/dealers/:id` now returns `finance_policy` and `warranty_policy` fields
- No backend code changes required - fields automatically returned by existing endpoint

### Architecture Context

**Reference Documentation:**
- Database Schema: `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`
- Data Models: `docs/architecture/data-models.md`
- Schema Changes: `docs/architecture/schema-changes-finance-warranty.md`

**Source Tree:**
- Public pages located in: `frontend/src/pages/public/`
- Reference Story 2.6 (About page) and Story 2.8 (Finance page) for component structure
- Uses DealershipContext for multi-tenancy support

**Existing Components to Reference:**
- `About.jsx` (Story 2.6) - nearly identical structure
- `Finance.jsx` (Story 2.8) - nearly identical structure (implement 2.8 first)
- `Header.jsx` - add navigation link here
- `App.jsx` - add route here

**Backend Routes:**
- `GET /api/dealers/:id` - existing route, already returns new fields after migration
- See: `docs/BACKEND_ROUTES_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `frontend/src/pages/public/__tests__/Warranty.test.jsx`

**Testing Standards:**
- Use React Testing Library
- Test component rendering, API calls, loading/error states
- Follow patterns from About.test.jsx and Finance.test.jsx
- Minimum 80% code coverage

**Manual Testing:**
- Test with dealership that has warranty_policy set
- Test with dealership that has null warranty_policy (verify default message)
- Test responsive layout on mobile (375px) and desktop (1024px+)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent implementation with clean, maintainable code. Component follows React best practices with proper hooks usage, error handling, and loading states. JSDoc documentation is comprehensive. Code is nearly identical to Finance.jsx which is appropriate for this use case.

**Architecture Compliance**: ✓ Follows established patterns from About.jsx (Story 2.6) and Finance.jsx (Story 2.8). Proper use of DealershipContext for multi-tenancy. Consistent Tailwind styling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/public/Warranty.jsx`
  - **Change**: Updated default message when warranty_policy is null (line 59)
  - **Why**: AC6 specifies full contact message, not generic "No warranty information available"
  - **How**: Changed to template literal with phone interpolation: `Contact us to learn about our warranty coverage. Call ${dealership?.phone} or submit an enquiry.`

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/public/Warranty.jsx`
  - **Change**: Added email subject parameter to mailto link (line 86)
  - **Why**: AC7 requires "Warranty Inquiry" as email subject
  - **How**: Updated href to `mailto:${dealership?.email}?subject=Warranty Inquiry`

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **PASS** - Follows React best practices, proper hooks usage
- Project Structure: ✓ **PASS** - Correctly placed in frontend/src/pages/public/
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **FAIL** - No unit tests exist (major gap)
- All ACs Met: ✓ **PASS** - All 12 acceptance criteria fully implemented after QA fixes

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

- **AC1-2 (Routing & Navigation)**: 
  - Given: User clicks "Warranty" link in header
  - When: Navigation occurs
  - Then: `/warranty` route loads Warranty component
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Route configured in App.jsx, link added to Header.jsx after Finance link

- **AC3 (API Data Fetch)**:
  - Given: Component mounts with valid dealership ID
  - When: useDealership hook executes
  - Then: GET /api/dealers/:id called successfully
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Uses useDealership hook with DealershipContext

- **AC4 (Page Heading)**:
  - Given: Dealership data loaded
  - When: Component renders
  - Then: "Warranty Information" displayed as H1 with dealership name
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Lines 51-53

- **AC5-6 (Warranty Policy Content)**:
  - Given: Dealership has warranty_policy set/null
  - When: Content section renders
  - Then: Policy text displayed with line breaks / default message shown
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Lines 58-60 with whitespace-pre-line CSS

- **AC7 (Contact CTA)**:
  - Given: Contact section renders
  - When: User clicks phone/email links
  - Then: tel: and mailto: links work with proper subject
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Lines 74-90 (fixed during QA review)

- **AC8 (Inventory Button)**:
  - Given: CTA section renders
  - When: User clicks button
  - Then: Navigates to /inventory
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Lines 98-100

- **AC9-10 (Styling & Responsive)**:
  - Given: Page renders on any device
  - When: Viewport changes
  - Then: Layout adapts with readable text
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Tailwind responsive classes, consistent with About and Finance pages

- **AC11-12 (Loading & Error States)**:
  - Given: API call pending/fails
  - When: Component renders
  - Then: Loading message / error message displays
  - **Coverage**: ✓ Lines 30-45

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed AC6 default message to match specification
- [x] Added email subject for AC7 compliance
- [ ] Add unit tests for Warranty component (Priority: High)
- [ ] Consider extracting contact section to shared component used by About, Finance, and Warranty (Priority: Low, reduces code duplication)

### Security Review

**Assessment**: ✓ **PASS**

- No direct user input handling in this component
- XSS protection handled by backend sanitization in dealers.js
- No sensitive data exposure
- Proper use of optional chaining (?.) prevents null reference errors

### Performance Considerations

**Assessment**: ✓ **PASS**

- Single API call on mount via useDealership hook
- Lightweight component with minimal re-renders
- Loading state prevents cumulative layout shift
- No performance concerns identified

### Files Modified During Review

1. `frontend/src/pages/public/Warranty.jsx` - Fixed AC6 default message and AC7 email subject
   - **Dev Action Required**: Please update File List in story to reflect QA fixes

### Gate Status

**Gate**: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.9-warranty-page.yml

**Reason**: All functional requirements met after QA fixes, but missing unit tests prevents PASS rating.

**Risk Profile**: Low risk - straightforward display component with proper error handling.

**Quality Score**: 85/100

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Add unit tests before marking "Done"

**Rationale**: While all acceptance criteria are met and code quality is excellent, the absence of unit tests creates technical debt and violates testing strategy. Recommend adding tests using React Testing Library to cover:
- Loading state display
- Error state display  
- Content rendering with policy text
- Content rendering with default message
- Contact link functionality
- Navigation link functionality

**Alternative**: If team accepts test debt for MVP, gate can be WAIVED with explicit approval from Product Owner.
