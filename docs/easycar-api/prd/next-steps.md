# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review this EasyCars API Integration PRD and create detailed UX specifications for the admin interface components, including wireframes for the credential management section, sync dashboard, and data reconciliation interface. Focus on providing dealership administrators intuitive, confidence-inspiring controls for managing this critical integration.

### Architect Prompt

Please review this EasyCars API Integration PRD and create a comprehensive technical architecture document. Design the system architecture covering: database schema details with indexes and constraints, API client architecture with token management and retry logic, background job scheduling strategy, data mapping and transformation layer, error handling and logging strategy, security implementation for credential encryption, and deployment considerations for test/production environments. Consider scalability for multiple dealerships and maintainability for future third-party integrations.
