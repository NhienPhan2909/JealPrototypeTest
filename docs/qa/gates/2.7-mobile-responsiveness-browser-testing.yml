# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.7"
story_title: "Mobile Responsiveness & Browser Testing"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Code implementation is excellent with proper responsive design patterns, but manual testing (AC9-12) for browser compatibility and performance verification remains incomplete."

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Manual testing incomplete: AC9-12 require actual browser/device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers, performance, console errors)"
    suggested_action: "Complete manual testing tasks marked as 'QA to verify' before production deployment"
    suggested_owner: "qa"
  - id: "TECH-DEBT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No automated tests for responsive design validation (acceptable per MVP tech stack but creates regression risk)"
    suggested_action: "Add visual regression tests (Playwright/Cypress) in Phase 2"

      refs: ["docs/stories/2.7.story.md:105-166"]
  future:
    - action: "Add visual regression tests for responsive design in Phase 2"
      refs: ["frontend/src/components/**/*.jsx"]
    - action: "Consider extracting mobile menu to reusable component"
      refs: ["frontend/src/components/Header.jsx:110-134"]

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Excellent JSDoc documentation on all modified files"
  - "Consistent mobile-first responsive design patterns"
  - "Proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, focus rings)"
  - "Touch target optimization meets WCAG 2.1 AA (44x44px minimum)"
  - "Image optimization with Cloudinary transformations and lazy loading"
  - "Clean, maintainable code following project standards"

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "frontend/src/components/EnquiryForm.jsx"
    change: "Updated submit button disabled state padding from py-2 to py-3"
    line: 257
    why: "Maintain consistent 44px touch target height when button is disabled during form submission"
    how: "Changed className conditional to use py-3 in both enabled and disabled states"
