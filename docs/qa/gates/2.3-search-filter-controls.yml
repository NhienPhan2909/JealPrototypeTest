  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side only feature with no security risks. React auto-escapes content, no data persistence, no API changes."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well optimized with debouncing (300ms) and useMemo. Filter/sort operations are O(n) and O(n log n) respectively, acceptable for expected dataset size."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, loading states, empty states, and edge case coverage. useEffect cleanup prevents memory leaks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation, clear code structure, self-documenting variable names, and inline comments explaining complex logic."
